#Crop changes

I noticed one thing with an image:

The image is of rectangular shape. When I uploaded the image, a border was nto detected. I added one and saved the disc.

When I was redirected back to front page I saw that the image was presented in landcape mode, even though it was in portrait mode when I was adding the border. Additionally, the border was totally malplaced with about 1/3 of the border rendered outside of the image.

What can we do about these orientational issues that the image is converted from portait to landscape after saving?
