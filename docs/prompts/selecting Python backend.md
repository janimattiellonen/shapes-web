#Selecting Python backend

I want to create a Python powered web app that allows a client software to upload an image and have the backend detect whether the image contains an ellipse, a rectangle, a triangle or neither of these three. Shape detection is doen using python (Keras) code so a pythin backend is favoarable.

At this point, shape detection is not relevant. I need you to suggest suitable python based web backend frameworks that would allow me to integrate existing shape detection code
